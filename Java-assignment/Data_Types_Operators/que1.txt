Q1. Explain the difference between primitive and reference data types with 
examples.
Ans) Primitive data types:
  Primitive data types are basic building blocks of data in Java. They are 
predefined by the language and store simple values directly in memory. 
Characteristics: 
• Stored in stack memory. 
• Fast and memory-efficient. 
• Holds only one value at a time. 
• Does not support methods. 
Primitive Datatypes: boolean,int,float,double,char.

Reference Datatypes:
 Reference data types are used to store objects. They hold a reference (memory 
address) to the actual data rather than the value itself. 
Characteristics: 
• Stored in heap memory. 
• Slower than primitive types. 
• Holds multiple values (as objects). 
• Can have methods and behaviors. 

Examples of Reference Data Types: 
• Objects (Instances of Classes) 
• Arrays 
• Strings 
• User-defined types (like interfaces and enums)
